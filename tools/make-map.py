"""Builds the Travel page's map (photos.html): every place I'm going, would like to go, or have been,
as a pin on a world map, with the countries I've been to tinted.

Run from the repo root after changing PINS or BEEN_COUNTRIES: python3 tools/make-map.py
The tests fail if the page no longer matches, or if a trip or wishlist card has no pin.

The coastlines are Natural Earth's public-domain 1:110m countries, as packaged by world-atlas
(tools/data/, see its README), in the Equal Earth projection. Colours come from styles.css, so the
map follows the light and dark themes. A "going" or "want" pin links to its card (id="place-…").
